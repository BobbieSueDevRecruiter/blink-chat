Blink Chat Repository

Blink Chat is a WebRTC based video chat system. It contains two servers:
• A main server used for website-serving and user handling, designed to be scalable to include other services (such as chat, online bidding, etc) as needed.
• A stream server that handles all webRTC signaling, including setup of video conference rooms and management of such groups
